## How to navigate this guide

Periodically check back here to see if new markets have been added to our supported chains.

### Terminology

**Origin chain:** The chain on which you currently have your funds that you want to bridge.

**Target chain:** The chain on which you want to receive tokens.&#x20;

_Example_: If you want to send ETH(Wormhole) from Ethereum (origin chain) to Solana (target chain). You need to chose this tab: ETH -> SOL

**Token (origin):** The token on the origin chain, from which you are sending your funds ([Full token list by origin here](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole-token-list/blob/main/content/by_source.csv)).

**Token (target):** The token that is minted on the target chain, on which you receive your funds ([Full token list by target here](https://github.com/certusone/wormhole-token-list/blob/main/content/by_dest.csv)).

**Markets:** Available, liquid markets on the target chain for swapping/pooling/staking/etc.

**Contract address:** The contract address of the token (target). You might need the contract address to manually add the token to your wallet (Phantom, Metamask, Terra Station, etc.)

**Notes:** additional information

### Portal naming conventions&#x20;
