# How to send USDC from Ethereum to Solana

USDC is deployed natively on both ETH and SOL, and wrapped versions of USDC from the two chains are not compatible with each other, so it's important to know which version of USDC you start with. Sending native USDC from Ethereum to Solana will result in USDCet. Sending native USDC from Solana to Ethereum will result in USDCso.

After moving your USDC cross-chain (from Ethereum to Solana, for example), you'll then need to use a swap platform (like Saber or Mercurial) to swap your Wormhole wrapped token into native USDC on Solana. Here is a tutorial on how to send USDC from Ethereum to Solana and using a swap platform to obtain native USDC.

### Summary:

1. Transfer USDC from Ethereum to Solana. You will receive ETH-USDC (Wormhole)
2. Use a swap platform such as Saber or Mercurial to swap to native USDC
3. Success! You now have native USDC on Solana.
