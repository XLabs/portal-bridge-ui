# How to send USDC from Solana to Ethereum

Sending USDC directly from Solana to Ethereum will result in USDCso (Wormhole from Solana) which will require _an additional swap_ and hence another (expensive) transaction on Ethereum. Instead, to receive native USDC on Ethereum, users should send USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum) from Solana to Ethereum. Here is a tutorial on how to receive native USDC on Ethereum using the Portal.

First, you will need USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum) in order to transfer the token to Ethereum. You can obtain this either via Mercurial, Jupiter or Saber. In this example, we will use Mercurial.

### Summary:

* Obtain USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum) by using a swap platform such as Mercurial
* Send USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum) to Ethereum using the Portal
* Success! You now have USDC on Ethereum

### Step 1 - Obtaining USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum)

* Head to [https://mercurial.finance/](https://mercurial.finance/)
* Connect your wallet
* In the "You pay" drop-down menu, select the token you want to swap
* In the "You receive" drop-down menu, select USDCet (Wormhole from Ethereum)
* Click "Swap"
* Approve the wallet pop up
