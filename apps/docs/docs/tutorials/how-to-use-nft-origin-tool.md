# NFT Origin tool

Users may use the NFT Origin tool to help manually verify the authenticity of an NFT.&#x20;

_Note: The tool only tells you the origin of a NFT which can help you to verify it manually. It will not tell you whether a NFT is a real or fake._&#x20;

## For NFTs sent from Solana -> Ethereum&#x20;

#### Using the NFT origin tool:

* Navigate to the NFT origin tool: [https://portalbridge.com/#/nft-origin-verifier](https://portalbridge.com/#/nft-origin-verifier)
* Select the chain the NFT is currently on (Ethereum) & connect your wallet
* Paste the address & tokenId
* Click view sol scan

## How to manually verify the NFT is authentic:

You can manually verify the NFT's authenticity via the creator address & mint address.

On Solscan, we can compare the creator addresses with another NFT on a verified NFT collection in a marketplace such as [solanart.io](http://solanart.io).

* Head to [solanart.io](http://solanart.io) & select the collection. In this example we are using Degen Ape Academy which has a verified collection of Degen Apes.

When you compare the two, the two creator addresses & update authority are identical so you can manually verify that the piece is authentic.
