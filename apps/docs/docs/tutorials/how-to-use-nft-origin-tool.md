# NFT Origin tool

Users may use the NFT Origin tool to help manually verify the authenticity of an NFT.&#x20;

## How to manually verify the NFT is authentic:

You can manually verify the NFT's authenticity via the creator address & mint address.

On Solscan, we can compare the creator addresses with another NFT on a verified NFT collection in a marketplace such as [solanart.io](http://solanart.io).

* Head to [solanart.io](http://solanart.io) & select the collection. In this example we are using Degen Ape Academy which has a verified collection of Degen Apes.

When you compare the two, the two creator addresses & update authority are identical so you can manually verify that the piece is authentic.
