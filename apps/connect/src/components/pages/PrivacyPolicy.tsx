              <b>No fee usually required:</b> You will not have to pay a fee to
              access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other
              rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request

              refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may
              need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
              your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data
              (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
              measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any
              person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
              ask you for further information in relation to your request to

              <b>Period for replying to a legitimate request:</b> We try to

              it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly
              complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we
              will notify you and keep you updated.

              the blockchain may include purchases, sales, and transfers related
